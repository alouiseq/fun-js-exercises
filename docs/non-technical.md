## Use Situation-Task-Action-Result (STAR)

**Situation: Describe the event, problem, or challenge you encountered. This must describe a specific situation, not your whole professional experience.**

**Task: Describe the task you had ownership over within the situation. What goal were you working toward? Be sure to keep it specific and highlight the challenges you faced.**

**Action: What did you (not your team) decide to do? What steps did you take to address the situation? Focus on your actions, while being humble, and acknowledging the accomplishments of your team. Make sure that your actions highlight the characteristics the company is seeking, such as initiative, teamwork, leadership, perseverance, etc.**

**Result: Describe what happened as a result of your actions; and if possible, back up your success with hard numbers. This is also an opportunity for you to be a bit introspective and speak about what you learned or mightâ€™ve done differently.**
