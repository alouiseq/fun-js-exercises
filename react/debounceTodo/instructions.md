### Debounce Todo

# 1. Change the jsFiddle boilerplate ToDo React App and allow the user to select/deselect the items on the list.
# 2. Convert the class component to a functional component and use hooks
# 3. Implement a method that will limit the rate that the user is able to select/deselect an item. An item should not be able to be interacted with for a given time.
# 4. Implement a progress bar that is filled up based on the items that have been done (checked). If the user selects an item, a portion of the progress is filled and if deselected, the progress should be reduced. Checking off all the items should render the progress at 100% and 0% if no items are selected.
