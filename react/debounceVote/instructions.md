### Debounce Voting (React)

# 1. Create a react component that allows the user to vote to either like or dislike. The requirements are two buttons Like/Dislike and a count value next to each indicating the numer of votes. Selecting one will either increase/decrease the vote depending if it has been previously selected. Style the button and its contents if it is activated. If a button is activated and selected, deactivate the button and reduce the count. If deactivated and selected, activate the button and increase the count  (also deactivate and reduce the count of the other button if activated).
# 2. If react class is used, convert to a functional component and use hooks.
# 3. Write a debouncer method that disallows the user from rapidly selecting the buttons. It will prevent the user to vote until the delay has been reached. You can implement a trailing debouncer where the user action is executed at the end of the delay.
# 4. If trailing debouncer was implemented,  now implement the debouncer at the start of the delay - meaning allow user action as soon as they select a button and then delay any subsequent actions until after the delay is reached.
